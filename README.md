## Description

World Quest Tab is a world quest add-on designed to be as lightweight as possible, while looking and feeling as part of Blizzard's default UI.

## Features

1.  **Seamless Blizzard UI Integration** – The add-on blends perfectly into Blizzard's standard interface without unnecessary complexity.
2.  **New Quest Overview** – An additional tab in the quest log provides a list of world quests, adapting to the current map view (zone, continent, or entire expansion).
3.  **Enhanced Map Pins** – Quest pins on the map display reward icons with a time ring, along with small symbols for quest type (pet battle, invasion, etc.) and reward type, fully customizable.
4.  **Flexible Sorting and Filtering** – World quests can be sorted by time remaining, zone, faction, quest type, name, and reward type, with filtering options to refine the list.
5.  **User-Friendly Customization** – Multiple configuration options allow players to tailor the display, showing only relevant quests.

A lightweight and efficient tool for managing world quests!
